<p class="justify-content-sm-around "> The job or employment application is the official form that employers ask all applicants for a position to fill out. The job application is filled out offline in a pen and paper format or, increasingly, online. The job application (see a variety of sample job applications) provides a consistent format with the same questions that must be answered by each person who applies for an open position.


    The job application is a legally defensible listing of your job applicantâ€™s employment history, educational background, degrees, qualifications, references, and more. </p>
